# Contribution Guidelines

1. Make an individual pull request for each suggestion and include a reason why it is awesome.
2. Always add your items to the end of the list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
