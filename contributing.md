# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! Please note that Will and Jeff work on this as a benefit to the Django community. It is based on our own personal, biased thoughts. 

If you disagree with choices made, you are welcome to fork this repo and create/maintain your own list of awesome Django resources if you disagree with choices I've made.

That said, we will review any and all contributions. Here's the process:

1. Make an individual pull request for each suggestion and include a reason why it is awesome.
2. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve so unless a section is alphabetical, add the item at the end.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
