# Contribution Guidelines

It's almost inevitable that any `awesome` repo will bloat over time and become less and less curated. To guard against that and to protect my own time, please be aware that while contributions are encouraged at the end of the day this repo is largely my own personal, biased thoughts.

You are welcome to fork this and create/maintain your own list of awesome Django resources if you disagree with choices I've made.

That said, I'm eager to and will review any and all contributions. Here's the process:

1. Make an individual pull request for each suggestion and include a reason why it is awesome.
2. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve so unless a section is alphabetical, add the item at the end.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
